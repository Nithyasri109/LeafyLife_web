## 🚀 Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

---

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.  
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

---

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.  
See the section about running tests for more information.

---

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.  
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and filenames include hashes.  
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the deployment section below for more information.

---

### `npm run eject`

⚠️ **Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time.  
This command will remove the single build dependency and copy all configuration files (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) into your project.

You don’t need to use eject for most applications.
